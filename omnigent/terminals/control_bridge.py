"""Shared tmux control-mode (``tmux -C``) ↔ WebSocket bridge.

Alternative transport to :mod:`omnigent.terminals.ws_bridge`. Where the PTY
bridge forks a full ``tmux attach`` client and streams the rendered screen,
this bridge attaches a *control-mode* client and consumes tmux's line protocol:

- ``%output <pane-id> <octal-escaped-bytes>`` — the raw bytes the program in a
  pane just produced, forwarded to the browser xterm.js as binary frames. The
  browser terminal therefore owns the character grid, scrollback, and text
  selection (tmux's own status line / copy-mode chrome is never streamed to a
  control client), which is what gives native scrolling and copy in the web UI.
- ``%begin <t> <n> <flags>`` … ``%end``/``%error <t> <n> <flags>`` — bracketed
  reply blocks for commands the bridge sends, correlated by command number.
- ``%exit`` / ``%window-close`` / ``%layout-change`` — lifecycle + structure.

Design notes learned from the protocol (see ``control_bridge`` spike):

- Attach with ``-C`` (NOT ``-CC``): ``-CC`` requires the parent be a real
  terminal and the client exits immediately when stdin/stdout are pipes. ``-C``
  gives the same protocol with echo already off, which is what we want for a
  programmatic consumer reading/writing pipes.
- A control client only receives ``%output`` produced *after* it attaches, so
  the bridge seeds the browser terminal with ``capture-pane -e -p`` (escapes
  preserved) once on connect, then streams subsequent ``%output``.
- Browser input bytes are injected with ``send-keys -H <hh> <hh> ...``
  (space-separated hex, one token per byte). Feeding raw ESC/control bytes into
  a ``send-keys -l`` command line corrupts the line-based command parser and
  the client exits; the hex channel is byte-exact for ESC sequences, control
  chars, and UTF-8 multibyte alike.

The browser-facing wire protocol is identical to the PTY bridge (binary frames
out = raw pane bytes; text frames in = JSON ``{"type":"resize",...}``; binary
frames in = input bytes), so the two transports are interchangeable behind the
same ``/attach`` WebSocket and a client cannot tell which one served it.

Known limitation vs the PTY bridge: tmux's own overlays (``display-popup``,
copy-mode, status line) are NOT delivered to a control-mode client, so the
native cost-approval popup (:mod:`omnigent.native_cost_popup`) does not render
in a control-mode browser terminal. That popup is a secondary convenience for
users working in a real native TTY; the web ApprovalCard (SSE-driven) remains
the primary approval surface and is unaffected. The harnesses' own input,
paste, and readiness logic run tmux commands directly against the socket
(``send-keys``/``load-buffer``/``capture-pane``) and are independent of the
attach transport, so they behave identically under either bridge.

    """Capture the current pane screen (with escapes) to seed the browser view.

    A control client only receives ``%output`` produced after it attaches, so
    the pane's pre-attach content must be seeded explicitly. ``-e`` preserves
    SGR/color escapes so the seed paints identically to the live pane.

    ``capture-pane -p`` separates rows with a **bare LF** (``\\n``, no carriage
    return). Written verbatim into xterm.js each LF moves the cursor down but
    not to column 0, so every row starts where the previous one ended — the
    whole seed staircases to the right. We rewrite each row separator to
    ``\\r\\n`` so the grid paints flush-left, matching the live ``%output``
    stream (which already carries CRLF). Home + clear (``\\x1b[H\\x1b[2J``) is
    prepended so the seed lands on a clean screen at the top-left.

    ``capture-pane`` records only the cell contents, not the cursor. Writing
    the seed leaves the browser cursor wherever the last row ended, not where
    the application actually parked it (e.g. inside a prompt input box). We
    query ``#{cursor_x}`` / ``#{cursor_y}`` and append a CUP escape so the
    cursor is restored to its real position, and honor ``#{cursor_flag}`` so a
    hidden cursor stays hidden.

    **Scrollback**, conditioned on the screen mode:

    - **Primary screen** (a shell, the polly REPL): capture from the start of
      history (``-S -``) so the browser recovers the full scrollback, not just
      the visible screen. The extra history lines scroll into xterm's own
      scrollback as they're written; the cursor CUP is screen-relative so it
      still lands correctly on the visible grid.
    - **Alternate screen** (claude, codex, vim): capture the visible screen
      only. The alternate buffer has no scrollback, and ``-S -`` would leak the
      stale *primary*-screen history from before the app switched buffers —
      lines that were never part of the app's UI — corrupting the seed. tmux's
      ``#{alternate_on}`` distinguishes the two.

    **Screen/input modes** (alt screen, mouse tracking, DECCKM) are replayed
    around the content via :func:`_mode_restore_escapes` — capture-pane records
    cells only, and a TUI that enabled these before this client attached would
    otherwise be unscrollable in the browser (see that function's docstring).
