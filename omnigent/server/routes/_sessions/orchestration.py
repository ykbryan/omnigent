    Publish one harness-originated elicitation and wait for web verdict.

    Mirrors the ``omnigent claude`` permission hook contract: the
    hook parks a server-side Future, publishes the standard
    ``response.elicitation_request`` event, waits until the session
    ``approval`` event resolves the Future, and always publishes
    ``response.elicitation_resolved`` when the upstream wait ends.

    The wait ends on the first of three signals: (1) the web verdict
    Future (session ``approval`` event); (2) the terminal-resolved
    Event, set when a mirrored tool result for this gated tool proves
    the prompt was answered in the native TUI (see
    :func:`_signal_terminal_resolved_harness_elicitation`); or (3)
    upstream disconnect / ``timeout_s``. Only (1) yields a verdict;
    (2) and (3) return ``None`` (fail-ask). (1) and (2) publish
    ``response.elicitation_resolved`` immediately; (3) defers it by
    ``_HARNESS_ELICITATION_REPARK_GRACE_S`` and skips it when the
    caller re-parks the same ``elicitation_id`` (hook retries after a
    severed long-poll reuse their id), so a still-blocked prompt's
    card survives the gap. A caller-supplied id likewise re-attaches
    to a verdict that landed during a gap via the pre-resolved
    tombstone, returned at registration time without re-publishing.

    :param request: FastAPI request object so upstream disconnect can
        be detected.
    :param session_id: Omnigent session id, e.g. ``"conv_abc123"``.
    :param params: Elicitation params to publish.
    :param timeout_s: Maximum wait in seconds, e.g. ``300.0``.
    :param conversation_store: Optional store used to mirror
        child-session prompts into ancestor streams. ``None`` keeps
        the prompt scoped to ``session_id`` only.
    :param elicitation_id: Optional precomputed correlation id, e.g.
        ``"elicit_codex_abc123"``. ``None`` mints a random id.
    :param tool_name: Gated tool name, e.g. ``"Bash"``, used to
        correlate a mirrored tool result back to this prompt for the
        terminal-resolved fast path. ``None`` (e.g. Codex) disables
        that correlation; the prompt still resolves via web verdict,
        disconnect, or timeout.
    :param tool_input: Gated tool input, e.g. ``{"command": "ls"}``,
        used with ``tool_name`` to disambiguate the result when several
        same-named prompts are parked at once.
    :returns: Web verdict, or ``None`` on terminal-side resolution,
        timeout, or disconnect.

    Increment the session's cumulative token counters from a

    Called synchronously from the relay loop. Builds a usage delta from

    persisted ``session_usage`` via a single database transaction

    otherwise). This prevents the read-modify-write race that caused

    token deltas (#9). No-op when the response carries no usage data.

    Cost is computed when the model's per-token pricing is
    available from the MLflow catalog (looked up once per call
    from the response's ``model`` field). When the harness instead

    Persist cumulative cost / token usage reported by a native harness.

    Unlike the Omnigent relay path (:func:`_accumulate_session_usage`), which adds
    per-response *deltas*, native harnesses (claude-native / codex-native)
    report *cumulative* session usage — so the flat session fields are written
    with SET semantics. The per-model ``by_model`` buckets are the exception:
    they accumulate each report's growth (new - old) attributed to the active
    model, so they stay correct across mid-session model switches (see below).
    The two paths never run for the same session, so they don't conflict.

    Reads explicit cumulative fields from the ``external_session_usage`` event's
    ``data`` (all optional; a no-op when none are present):

    - ``cumulative_cost_usd`` — total session cost for DISPLAY, e.g.
      claude-native forwards Claude Code's own ``cost.total_cost_usd``
      (exact billing; used directly). Stored in ``total_cost_usd``, which
      drives the badge and the per-user daily rollup, so the badge matches
      ``/cost`` in the Claude TUI.
    - ``policy_cost_usd`` — total session cost for ENFORCEMENT (the
      cost-budget gate). claude-native forwards ``max(S, real-time
      transcript estimate)`` here so the gate reflects in-flight sub-agent
      spend while the displayed ``S`` is frozen for the sub-agent's run.
      Stored verbatim in ``policy_cost_usd`` (the policy engine seeds from
      it, falling back to ``total_cost_usd`` when absent). Not fed into the
      daily rollup — that uses the authoritative ``total_cost_usd``.
    - ``cumulative_input_tokens`` / ``cumulative_output_tokens`` — total session
      tokens, e.g. codex-native's ``tokenUsage.total``. When
      ``cumulative_cost_usd`` is absent, cost is computed from these via
      :func:`fetch_model_pricing`.
    - ``cumulative_cache_read_input_tokens`` — the cached portion *included
      in* ``cumulative_input_tokens`` (e.g. codex-native's
      ``tokenUsage.total.cachedInputTokens``). Split out of the input total
      so :func:`compute_llm_cost` prices it at the cache-read rate rather
      than the full input rate. Absent for harnesses that don't report it.
    - ``model`` — LLM model id to price with (e.g. ``"databricks-gpt-5-5"``);
      falls back to the agent spec's model when absent.

    The ``total_cost_usd`` key is written only on the priced branches
    below (exact billing, or token-priced when the model is in the
    catalog), so an unpriced native session leaves it absent — the same
    "priced ⟺ key present" contract the relay path uses. ``policy_cost_usd``
    is written only when the event carries it (claude-native with the
    display/policy split); codex-native and the relay omit it and the
    policy engine falls back to ``total_cost_usd``.

       ownership mismatch silently skips resolution — the runner
       forward below still fires so a runner-side elicitation with
       the same id can reject it on its own terms.
    2. **Sidebar badge clear.** Publish
       ``response.elicitation_resolved`` so every subscribed client
       (other tabs, the REPL TUI) flips its ``ApprovalCard`` and the
       pending-elicitation badge decrements. Idempotent.
    3. **Runner forward.** Runner-side elicitations (policy
       approvals parked in the runner's ``_pending_approvals`` dict)
       resolve when the approval event reaches the runner's
       ``/events``. Forwarded as a canonical ``approval`` event.

    Hold a server-side ASK gate until a human resolves it.

    render the approve card) and parks a server-side Future via
    :func:`_publish_and_wait_for_harness_elicitation`, exactly as the
    ``PermissionRequest`` hook does. The human approves through the
    elicitation's resolve URL; this collapses the verdict to a single
    boolean the caller maps to ALLOW / DENY.

    Used for any phase whose ASK must be resolved on the server rather
    than by a runner-side ``wait_for_user_approval`` park:
    :attr:`Phase.TOOL_CALL` (the native ``PreToolUse`` hook gate) and
    :attr:`Phase.REQUEST` (the user-message input gate, which has no
    runner in the loop yet — see :func:`_evaluate_input_policy`).

    Unlike the old ASK→``defer`` path, the gate lives on the server,
    so a permissive native ``permission_mode`` (``acceptEdits`` /
    ``bypassPermissions``) cannot skip it — the action stays blocked
    until a real human verdict. Timeout / disconnect fail closed
    (return ``False`` → DENY).

    On approve, the ASK-accumulated ``set_labels`` / ``state_updates``
    are applied (POLICIES.md §7.2: side effects land only on approve);
    a denied / timed-out ASK leaves no trace.

    :param request: FastAPI request, for upstream-disconnect detection
        inside the parking helper.
    :param session_id: Omnigent session id, e.g. ``"conv_abc123"``.
    :param phase: Enforcement phase being gated, e.g.
        :attr:`Phase.TOOL_CALL` or :attr:`Phase.REQUEST`.
    :param data: The proto event ``data`` — for a tool call,
        ``{"name": "Bash", "arguments": {"command": "ls"}}``; for a
        request, the user ``message`` body
        (``{"role": "user", "content": [...]}``).
    :param engine: The policy engine, used to resolve the per-policy
        ``ask_timeout`` and to apply approved side effects.

    :param conversation_store: Store used to mirror child-session
        prompts into ancestor streams.
    :param elicitation_id: Optional stable re-attach id from the
        calling hook, e.g. ``"elicit_evaluate_abc123"``. When supplied,
        ``_publish_and_wait_for_harness_elicitation`` re-attaches to the
        existing parked elicitation rather than publishing a new card —
        used by ``POST /policies/evaluate`` retries so a hook retry after
        a transient 5xx / connect-drop does not prompt the human twice.

    A sub-agent child copies its parent's ``runner_id`` once at creation and is

    the ancestor chain (immediate parent → root) to find the nearest live runner,

    ``runner_id`` is now in the DB).  Whether session re-initialization is
    needed depends on the harness:

    - **Native-terminal harnesses** (``pi-native``, ``claude-native``): the
      replacement runner does not automatically spawn the child's terminal
      process — the caller must set ``_runner_needs_session_init = True`` so
      ``_ensure_runner_session_initialized`` creates it.
    - **SDK / non-native harnesses**: all active sub-agent sessions are loaded
      in-process by the runner on startup; the parent's live runner already
      holds the child's session state, so ``_runner_needs_session_init``

    host row is durable, so a new sandbox generation can be provisioned

    the first message kicks the background relaunch, concurrent and

    Drive — and wait for — the runner's session-init handshake.

    Posts ``POST /v1/sessions`` to a freshly (re)launched runner and
    awaits it, so the runner's ``create_session`` completes before the
    caller forwards a message. For a claude-native session that means
    the tmux terminal **and its transcript forwarder are watching**
    before the web message is injected into the TUI — the round-trip
    that promotes the optimistic bubble and streams the reply only
    happens if the forwarder is in place first.

    This closes the host-restart race: today the auto-relaunch /
    resume paths wait only for the runner's *tunnel* to register
    (``runner_client`` becomes non-None), not for the session
    handshake, so the message can be injected before the forwarder
    attaches and is lost. The new / runner-bound paths don't hit this
    because they run the handshake as a distinct step before any
    message (``create_session`` endpoint) or against a from-offset-0
    forwarder.

    Current servers route this and ``_on_runner_connect`` through one
    generation-aware initializer, so both callers await the same response.
    The runner retains its own single-flight as the compatibility backstop for
    older servers and cross-replica delivery.

    Best-effort and matching the create / PATCH handshakes: a transport
    error is logged and swallowed (the relay + ``_on_runner_connect``
    are the backstop), but the *await* — the actual fix — still
    serializes the handshake ahead of the caller's message forward.

        ``"conv_abc123"``.

        set whenever the caller will forward a message immediately after

        session-init, so the runner's history load would otherwise see
        the pending message and start a recovery turn — the subsequent
        forward then arrives to an active turn, is buffered, and is
        processed a second time once the (redundant) recovery turn

    Forward an item-event to the runner with harness-aware dispatch.

    Callers stay harness-agnostic — the claude-native message bypass
    is encapsulated here. Two dispatch outcomes:

    * **transcript-forwarded native + ``type == "message"``**: web-chat user
      messages on these sessions must NOT be persisted by the AP
      server. The Omnigent would otherwise persist an AP-side copy AND
      let the transcript forwarder mirror the same message back
      (with its own store-assigned item id), so every web-typed
      prompt would land as two items in the chat panel. We forward
      to the bound runner so the native harness types the
      message into tmux; the transcript forwarder becomes the
      single writer for the conversation history. Returns a result
      with ``item_id=None`` (no AP-side persisted item) and a
      ``pending_id`` for the optimistic-bubble index entry.

    * **All other cases**: persist the item AP-side (invariant I1:
      persist-before-forward) and forward via the harness's
      ``/events`` scaffold. Returns the persisted item id and
      ``pending_id=None``.

    The single-writer invariant is the entire reason the bypass
    exists; do NOT collapse the two branches into a single forward
    that always persists. Doing so on a native session causes
    duplicate items in the chat panel as soon as the transcript
    forwarder mirrors the same prompt back.

    The pending-input entry recorded on the native path bridges the
    transcript round-trip: until the forwarder mirrors the message
    back, it lives nowhere durable, so a client that navigates away /
    rebinds would lose the optimistic bubble. The entry is replayed
    into the snapshot and drained when the message persists (see
    :mod:`omnigent.runtime.pending_inputs`). It is rolled back if the
    forward fails, so a never-delivered message leaves no ghost.

    :param session_id: Session/conversation identifier.
    :param conv: Conversation row for *session_id*.
    :param body: Validated event from the client.
    :param conversation_store: Used by the non-native path to
        persist the item.
    :param runner_client: The session's runner client, already
        resolved by the caller via :func:`_get_runner_client`.
    :param agent_name: Human-readable agent name for the
        ``model`` field on non-native forwards.
    :param file_store: Optional file metadata store for resolving
        ``file_id`` references before forwarding.
    :param artifact_store: Optional binary store for the same.
    :param has_mcp_servers: ``True`` when the agent spec declares at
        least one MCP server. Forwarded to the runner as the
        ``has_mcp_servers`` hint. ``False`` by default.
    :param created_by: Authenticated identity of the posting actor,
        e.g. ``"alice@example.com"``. On the non-native path it is
        recorded directly on the persisted item. On the claude-native
        bypass the transcript forwarder is the single writer, so
        ``created_by`` is stored in the ``pending_inputs`` entry via
        :func:`omnigent.runtime.pending_inputs.record` and applied
        to the item when the forwarder mirrors it back (see
        :func:`_persist_external_conversation_item`).
    :param author_attribution_required: Whether the authenticated sender is
        a shared-session collaborator.
    :param runner_router: Router used to resolve the runner for the
        native-terminal parent-wake forward when a sub-agent fails to
        boot (see :func:`_persist_native_terminal_failure`). ``None``
        in in-process / test setups where the global client is used.
    :param native_terminal_ready: A current initialization response already
        proved the terminal and forwarder ready, so the immediate duplicate
        ensure can be skipped.
    :returns: A :class:`_SessionEventDispatchResult` carrying the
        persisted item id (non-native) or the pending-input id

    Resolve the terminal-first wrapper labels for a native-harness sub-agent.

    A sub-agent dispatched via ``sys_session_send`` whose own spec uses a
    native terminal harness (``claude-native`` / ``codex-native``) must
    render with the Chat/Terminal pill in the web UI, exactly like a
    top-level ``claude-native-ui`` / ``codex-native-ui`` wrapper session.
    The pill is gated on the conversation's ``omnigent.wrapper`` +
    ``omnigent.ui`` labels (see ``web`` ``TerminalFirstContext``), but
    the sub-agent create path never stamps them. This resolves the child
    sub-agent's spec from the parent bundle and returns the labels to stamp,
    or an empty dict when the sub-agent is not native (e.g. ``claude-sdk``).

    :param agent: The parent agent row, e.g. the ``polly`` orchestrator,
        whose bundle contains the sub-agent specs.
    :param sub_agent_name: The dispatched sub-agent's name, e.g.

    2. Load session → agent → spec for policy evaluation.
    3. On first call: evaluate TOOL_CALL policy.  On DENY, return error.
       On ASK, emit a ``response.elicitation_request`` SSE event and
       return an MCP ``InputRequiredResult`` so the runner can park for
       user approval and retry per the MRTR spec.
    4. On retry (``requestState`` present in ``params``): verify the
       state, check the user's ``inputResponses``, and proceed if
       approved.
    5. Delegate execution to the runner's ``POST
       /v1/sessions/{id}/mcp/execute`` endpoint via the WS tunnel so
       that stdio MCP subprocesses and runner-local tools execute on the
       runner's machine (correct ``cwd``, environment, and tooling).
    6. Evaluate the TOOL_RESULT policy phase on the returned output;
       replace with a redaction notice on DENY.
    7. Return the result in MCP ``content`` format.

    :param rpc_id: The JSON-RPC request id, e.g. ``1``.
    :param session_id: The session id, e.g. ``"conv_abc123"``.

        contains ``"name"`` and ``"arguments"``.  On retry, also
        contains ``"requestState"`` (opaque blob from the server) and
        ``"inputResponses"`` (user's approval decision), e.g.
        ``{"name": "sys_os_shell", "arguments": {}, "requestState": "...",
        "inputResponses": {"elicit_abc": {"action": "accept"}}}``.

    :param agent_store: Store for agent lookup.
    :param runner_router: Router used to get a tunneled client pointed at
        the session's runner. ``None`` returns an error response.

        ``{"run_as": "alice@example.com"}``. ``None`` when
        identity is unknown.

        ``content`` blocks, an ``InputRequiredResult`` on ASK, or an
