"""OAuth 2.0 Device Authorization Grant endpoints (RFC 8628).

A generic delegated-login mechanism: any browserless client obtains a
delegated, per-user access token without a user credential ever passing
through the client. The client requests an authorization, relays a
verification link to the user, the user authenticates and consents in
their own browser, and the client polls for a token. The Slack
integration is the first consumer, but nothing here is Slack-specific —
the requesting application names itself with the RFC 8628 ``client_id``
(a public string like ``"slack"``; display + audit only).

Endpoints (all mounted at the app root):

- ``POST /oauth/device/authorize`` — issues ``device_code`` +
  ``user_code`` + verification URIs.
- ``GET  /oauth/device`` — the consent page; requires a browser
  identity (bounces through the provider's login when absent).
- ``POST /oauth/device/approve`` / ``POST /oauth/device/deny`` —
  authenticated browser actions binding the grant to the identity.
- ``POST /oauth/token`` — the client's polling / refresh endpoint;
  returns delegated access + refresh tokens.
- ``POST /oauth/revoke`` — revoke a grant (backs client logout).

Mounted only in ``accounts`` auth mode (and only when
``OMNIGENT_DEVICE_GRANT_ENABLED`` is set). OIDC deployments delegate login
to the IdP via the cli-ticket flow (``/auth/cli-login``) and never use this
grant; header mode has no server-mintable identity.

See ``designs/DEVICE_AUTH.md`` for the full design + threat model.

The security boundary is the secret ``device_code`` the client holds, the
ephemeral verification link, and the authenticated in-browser consent step
— backed by a short device_code TTL, a 30-day absolute grant lifetime,
per-IP rate limiting on authorize, and the consent-page warning against
approving an unexpected login.

Optionally, setting ``OMNIGENT_DEVICE_CLIENT_SECRET`` on the server gates
the CLIENT-facing endpoints (authorize / token / revoke) behind a shared
secret header, so only an authorized client (e.g. the Slack socket server,
which holds the matching secret and a fixed server URL) can drive the flow.
When unset the endpoints stay public. This is safe to ship to the client
now that its server target is a fixed operator config rather than a
user-supplied URL (which is why the secret was previously removed).

Refresh tokens: short access tokens + rotating, revocable refresh tokens.
