"""
Harness-aware host/plugin skill discovery for the web composer's
slash-command menu.

The runner's ``_resolve_session_skills`` unions a session's bundled
skills with the *extra* skills its harness surfaces in its own terminal.
"What a harness exposes" differs per vendor (Claude Code plugins, Codex
``~/.codex/skills``, Cursor ``~/.cursor``), so resolution dispatches to a
per-family provider. Unknown harnesses fall back to the generic host walk
(``discover_host_skills``) for backwards compatibility.
