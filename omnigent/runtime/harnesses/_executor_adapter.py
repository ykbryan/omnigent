"""
Shared adapter that wraps any inner :class:`Executor` instance as
a :class:`HarnessApp` subclass.

The four per-harness wraps (claude-sdk, codex, pi,
openai-agents-sdk) all use this adapter — they only differ in the
inner ``Executor`` they construct. The adapter handles:

- Per-conversation lazy executor construction (Layer 1 state on
  the adapter instance).
- Per-turn translation of Omnigent :class:`CreateResponseRequest` →
  inner :class:`Message` list + :class:`ExecutorConfig`.
- Per-turn translation of inner :class:`ExecutorEvent`s →
  typed Omnigent SSE events emitted via :meth:`TurnContext.emit`.
- Forwarding ``request.tools`` and ``request.instructions`` to
  the inner Executor; wiring a ``_tool_executor`` callback so
  the inner SDK round-trips spec-declared tools through
  :meth:`TurnContext.dispatch_tool` (the scaffold's
  action_required path).
- Cancellation propagation (POST /cancel → ctx.cancelled →
  inner ``Executor.interrupt_session``).
- Per-conversation cleanup on shutdown.

V1 limitations (documented in §Autonomous decisions):

- **No per-conversation executor configuration via spec.** The
  per-harness wrap's executor factory determines configuration
  (cwd, model, sandbox, credentials) at construction time. A
  follow-up should thread spec config through the request body
  or via subprocess env vars.

# Prefix the Claude SDK applies to MCP-registered tool names
# (e.g. ``mcp__omnigent__sys_terminal_launch``). Tools whose
# name starts with this prefix round-trip through the inner
# executor's ``_tool_executor`` callback -> :func:`_bridge_one_dispatch`
# -> ``ctx.dispatch_tool``, which emits an action_required
# function_call event POST-STREAM (the SDK's MCP-server handler
# fires after the assistant message finishes streaming).
#
# Adapter strategy for MCP tools:
#
# 1. Emit the observed function_call event INLINE (when the
#    inner SDK yields ToolCallRequest). That's what gives the
#    REPL the ``⏵ tool_name`` line interleaved with text rather
#    than bunched at the end of the turn.
# 2. Queue the SDK's ``tool_use_id`` so the post-stream
#    dispatch uses the SAME ``call_id`` (see
#    ``self._pending_mcp_call_ids``). Correlated ids let the
#    SDK client's ``BlockStream`` dedupe the action_required
#    event against the inline observed event — single render,
#    no duplicates.
# 3. Skip the observed function_call_output emission on
#    ToolCallComplete — the dispatch's PATCH handler emits the
#    paired output. Keeps the dedup story symmetric.

class ExecutorAdapter(HarnessApp):
    """
    :class:`HarnessApp` subclass that drives any inner
    :class:`Executor` instance.

    The per-harness wrap supplies an ``executor_factory`` —
    a zero-arg callable that constructs the inner executor. The
    adapter calls it lazily on the first turn (so heavyweight
    constructors like :class:`ClaudeSDKExecutor`'s eager
    Databricks credential resolution don't fire at FastAPI
    boot, only when a real conversation starts).

    The factory's return value is cached as Layer 1 state on the
    adapter instance — reused across turns for the conversation's
    lifetime. ``shutdown()`` calls ``executor.close()`` on
    teardown.

    :param executor_factory: Zero-arg callable returning a fresh
        :class:`Executor`. Tests pass a ``lambda:
        MockExecutor()``; production wraps pass a lambda that

        appropriate to the spec, e.g. ``lambda:
        ClaudeSDKExecutor(databricks=True, databricks_profile="<your-profile>")``.
    :param session_key: Stable identifier the inner executor uses
        to scope per-session state (clients, subprocesses). The
        adapter passes this to ``executor.close_session()`` and
        ``executor.interrupt_session()``. Defaults to a uuid hex
        — production wraps may want to set it from the
        ``conversation_id`` once the runner exposes it on
        ``app.state``.
