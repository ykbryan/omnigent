``build_policy_engine`` — construct a :class:`PolicyEngine` for a
workflow.

Called at the top of ``_run_agent_loop``. Seeds any
``LabelDef.initial`` values that are not already present in
``conversation_labels`` using an
``INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`` semantic so that two
concurrent workflows on the same conversation (the v2 case
tracked in POLICIES.md Open Q #6) never clobber each other's
view of a label's first value.

Phase 2 scope: zero-policy and declared-policy paths both work;
concrete Policy subclasses land in Phases 3+, and this builder
will start instantiating them as those phases ship.

    policies are stored, returns a no-op engine with empty
    policies and labels — the four enforcement sites still
    call through, they just always ALLOW.

    When declared labels have an ``initial`` value and no row
    exists yet in ``conversation_labels``, seeds via
    ``ConversationStore.set_labels`` — but only for keys not

    snapshot.

    Policy run order: session policies (from the CRUD API)
    first, then agent spec policies, then *default_policies*
    (server-wide admin policies). This lets user-configured
    session policies short-circuit on DENY before agent or
    admin policies run, and gives admin policies the last
    word on ALLOW/ASK decisions.

    For sub-agent conversations, session policies from the
    root (top-level) conversation are inherited and prepended
    before any child-specific session policies. This ensures
    guardrails set on the parent session (e.g. via
