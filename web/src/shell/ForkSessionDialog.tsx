 * ReconnectSessionDialog's Clone tab. Renders the scrollable field stack
 * plus its own footer (Cancel / Clone); the host dialog provides the
 * surrounding `DialogContent` and header.
 *
 * Forks the active (top-level) session via ``POST /v1/sessions/{id}/fork``
 * (the server deep-copies the transcript and clones the agent into a fresh
 * session owned by the caller; comments and permissions are NOT copied and
 * future messages don't mutate the source). For a *coding* source (one with
 * a working directory), the form also picks a host + directory + optional
 * git worktree and binds the fork to a runner via ``launchRunner``
 * (``POST /v1/hosts/{id}/runners``). For a non-coding source there is no
 * directory to pick, so it forks with just name + agent.
 *
 * Before creating anything, a coding fork pre-flights the picked directory
 * against the host (it must exist and be listable) — the launch below is
 * detached, so a bad path would otherwise produce a clone that silently
 * never starts. After that, the fork call is the only thing the form
 * awaits: on success it closes and
 * navigates into the clone IMMEDIATELY, and (for a coding source) fires the
 * runner launch in the background. Holding the dialog through the launch
 * blocks for as long as a worktree create takes (up to minutes) and hangs
 * forever on a dropped response, so the launch is detached. If it fails the
 * clone stays unbound and the user retries the bind via the session page's
 * directory picker (ChatPage's existing unbound-fork path). A fork-call
 * failure (nothing created) surfaces inline and the inputs stay editable for
 * a straight resubmit.
 *
 * Host/dir prefill from the *source*: its host is the default (when online)
 * and its workspace the default directory. When the source ran in a
 * server-created worktree, the prefill is instead the ORIGINAL repo as the
 * directory plus the source branch in the worktree field; submitted
 * untouched, the clone binds to the source's existing worktree directory
 * (renaming the branch creates a fresh worktree, automatically based off
 * the source branch). The Fork button greys out until a valid
 * online host + directory are chosen (no CLI fallback).
 *
 * All form state lives here, inside the dialog content, so closing the
 * dialog unmounts the form and resets it — no manual reset needed.
 *
 * @param sourceSessionId - Session being forked.
 * @param sourceTitle - Source title, used to prefill the fork's name.
 * @param sourceWorkspace - Source workspace; presence marks a coding source
 *   (shows the host/dir fields) and seeds the directory default.
 * @param sourceHostId - Source host; default host when it is online.
 * @param sourceGitBranch - Source git branch; drives the worktree prefill
 *   and the base ref for a renamed worktree branch.
 * @param upToResponseId - Truncation point for a "fork from here": the
 *   fork copies history only up to and including this response. `null` /
 *   omitted forks the full history.
 * @param onClose - Closes the host dialog (Cancel, and after a
 *   successful fork).
