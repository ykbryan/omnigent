    """
    POST ``/events`` with ``{"type":"compact"}`` on a cursor-native
    session submits ``/summarize`` via bracketed paste, returns 200, and
    raises the "Compacting…" spinner — but does NOT complete it.

    cursor-agent manages its own context window in the TUI, so explicit
    compaction must run there (its built-in ``/summarize`` command) rather
    than as AP-side compaction — the same rationale as the claude-native
    path.  The 200 (not 204) is load-bearing: the Omnigent server reads it to
    skip its own ``_run_compact_locked`` (which 400s on the LLM-less native
    pseudo-agent).

    Two properties are pinned here:

    1. **The command must go through the bracketed-paste path**
       (``inject_user_message``), NOT a ``send-keys``-typed slash command.
       Typing the literal ``/summarize`` opens cursor-agent's slash-command
       autocomplete dropdown, and the single submit Enter then confirms the
       highlighted completion instead of submitting the command — so the
       command was never sent (the original bug, seen as ``/summarize`` left
       sitting in the input box).
    2. **The handler raises the spinner but must NOT complete it.** It publishes
       ``response.compaction.in_progress`` (→ "Compacting conversation…") only.
       cursor-agent runs the summarization asynchronously in the pane after the
       submit, so completing here would flash "Conversation compacted" while
       the TUI is still summarizing.  The ``completed`` edge is emitted later by
       the cursor forwarder when it observes the summary blob (covered by
       ``tests/test_cursor_native_forwarder.py``).
