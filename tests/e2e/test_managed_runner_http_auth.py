"""End-to-end proof of the managed-sandbox runner HTTP-auth fix (#357 HTTP half).

A server-managed sandbox runner has no user credential of its own — only its
tunnel binding token. Under accounts/OIDC auth every runner->server HTTP
callback gates on ``require_user``, so before this fix those callbacks went out
bare and 401'd (the runner connected its tunnel but could never fetch its own
agent spec). The Option-C fix has the runner mint a short-lived owner JWT from
``POST /v1/runners/{id}/token`` (authenticated by its binding token) and present
it as ``Authorization: Bearer`` on every callback.

This test proves that fix works against a **real** ``omnigent server``
subprocess with accounts auth enabled, driving the runner's **real** outbound
code over a **real** TCP socket — no transports are stubbed:

* ``_make_auth_token_factory`` -> ``_make_managed_mint_factory`` ->
  ``_mint_managed_owner_token`` (a real ``httpx`` POST to the mint endpoint), and
* ``_RunnerDatabricksAuth`` on a real ``httpx.AsyncClient`` GET.

The only thing simulated is the managed-sandbox *condition* — no ``omnigent
login`` token and no Databricks config on disk — which is exactly what makes the
fix necessary (and what a fresh sandbox actually looks like).

The differential is asserted in one test, so the mint is provably the cause of
the flip:

* WITHOUT a minted token (``_RunnerDatabricksAuth(None)`` — precisely what
  ``_make_auth_token_factory`` returns for a managed sandbox on ``main``):
  ``GET /v1/sessions/{id}/agent/contents`` -> **401**.
* WITH the fix: the same GET -> **200**, returning the agent bundle.
