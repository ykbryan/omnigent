"""Guard tests for the declarative harness capability model.

Capabilities are declared per harness in ``_BUILTIN_CONTRIBUTION.capabilities``.
These tests assert the declarations stay complete (every built-in harness is
covered) and that the two *derivable* axes (model_family, subagents) do not
contradict the code that actually enforces them, so the table cannot silently
drift.
