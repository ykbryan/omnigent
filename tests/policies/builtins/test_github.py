"""
Tests for the built-in GitHub access policy
(:mod:`omnigent.policies.builtins.github`) — the single ``github_policy``
factory covering both the MCP tool-call surface and the git/gh shell surface.

Layers:

- **Layer 1** — direct callable: read / write allowlist gating across the
  official per-operation MCP tools, the ``github_*_api_call`` HTTP-proxy
  wrapper, and git/gh shell commands; branch-targeted vs non-branch writes;
  PR head-vs-base handling; MCP-prefix-agnostic matching; fail-closed on
  unknown GitHub tools; ASK on shell commands whose repo/branch cannot be
  resolved; and abstention on non-GitHub tools (the composition guarantee).
- **Layer 2** — spec resolution through :func:`resolve_function_policy`,
  proving both DENY and ASK decisions thread through the engine boundary.
- **Layer 3** — registry discovery: the one ``POLICY_REGISTRY`` factory entry
  is browsable and its schema validates good / bad params.

The policy is stateless (pure allowlist, no created-resource tracking), so —
unlike the Google builtin — there is no session_state round-trip layer.
